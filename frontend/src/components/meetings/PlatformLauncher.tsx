/** How you actually get into the call.
 *
 * LEADPILOT IS PLATFORM-AGNOSTIC, and this component is where that promise is
 * kept. Google Meet, Zoom and Teams all send `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (or the
 * CSP equivalent) on their join pages, so an iframe embed renders a blank box
 * — which is worse than no embed at all, because it looks broken rather than
 * absent. Every platform therefore gets the same two affordances: a prominent
 * button that opens the call in the tool the client already uses, and a copy
 * button for the raw link.
 *
 * The link is shown in full, not hidden behind the button, for the case that
 * actually happens on a sales call: the prospect cannot get in, and the user
 * needs to read the URL out or paste it into a chat window.
