"""Engagement Hub, Feature 1 — the automated follow-up.

THE ASSERTION THIS FILE EXISTS FOR is that the sweep does NOT fire for an
enrollment the sequence engine is already handling. schedule_next_step queues
step N+1 the moment step N sends; a sweep that also queued one would send the
same prospect two messages, and that is the failure nobody would notice in
staging and everybody would notice in a customer's inbox.

Everything else here follows from that: what IS left over (a permanently
failed send, a WhatsApp step stuck on needs_template, a step deleted
mid-flight), the idempotency lock, the auto-DM fallback when the sequence has
run out of steps, and the fact that every automatic send still goes through
the same compliance path as a scheduled one.
