"""Architecture tripwire: the queue a task is PUBLISHED to must be a queue a
worker actually CONSUMES.

This caught a total production outage. celery_app.py had no `task_routes`, so
every task went to Celery's implicit "celery" queue, while
docker-compose.prod.yml starts its workers bound to -Q pipeline / -Q outreach /
-Q learning,default. Nothing consumed "celery" and nothing was published to the
four declared queues, so in production the entire async backend — strategy
generation, outreach dispatch, reply polling, the learning loop, the beat
heartbeat — would have silently done nothing. It passed unnoticed in dev only
because the dev worker is started without -Q and therefore consumes "celery".

Do not delete these tests. If you add a task or rename a queue, fix the routing
or the compose file, not the assertion.
