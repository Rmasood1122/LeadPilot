"""Feature A7 — the pre-send adversarial review.

Pins: clean content launches; each blocking rule (spam, deceptive subject,
dropping the unsubscribe, unverifiable claims, placeholder sender identity in
production) stops enrollment AND manager approval with 409; warnings never
block; model findings are warnings only and a model failure never blocks; an
override needs a reason and a manager, is logged, and stops applying when the
content changes.
