"""
Integration-test conftest.

Provides:
  - pg_engine / db_session / sync_redis / redis_client — real PostgreSQL and
    Redis, overriding the root conftest's in-process SQLite fixtures
  - api_client — AsyncClient against the real app with those overrides
  - admin_client / user_a_client / user_b_client  — authed AsyncClient instances
  - factory helpers: create_product, create_past_clients, create_strategy, seed_outcomes
  - mock_transports with all 7 external APIs pre-registered

The PostgreSQL/Redis harness below used to live in the ROOT conftest, where
it replaced the SQLite fixture library the 22 root test modules are written
against and broke all of them. Only tests/integration/ ever used it - every
one of pg_engine / sync_redis / redis_client / api_client / mock_transports
is referenced from this directory and nowhere else - so it lives here now.

These fixtures need a running PostgreSQL and Redis (docker compose up db
redis); the root suite deliberately needs neither.
