"""One command that takes LeadPilot from "keys missing" to "production ready".

    python scripts/activate_with_keys.py

Runs eight checks IN ORDER and STOPS at the first failure, printing exactly
what to fix. Nothing after a failed check runs, because every later check
depends on the earlier ones being true: there is no point testing a domain
against a key that is rejected, and no point migrating a database you cannot
connect to.

WHY IT STOPS INSTEAD OF REPORTING EVERYTHING
A "5 of 8 passed" summary invites picking the easy failures first. The checks
are ordered by dependency, so the FIRST failure is always the one to fix, and
showing only that keeps the next action unambiguous.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT WILL DO TO YOUR SYSTEM
  * makes real, billed API calls to Anthropic and Resend
  * SENDS a real email to ADMIN_EMAIL
  * MIGRATES YOUR LIVE DATABASE -- but only after asking, in writing, and only
    if you type "yes"

It is safe to run repeatedly. Every check is read-only except 5 (guarded by
the prompt) and 6 (sends one email).

SAFETY
  --dry-run   run only the checks that need no network and no database, and
              report the rest as SKIPPED. Nothing is called, nothing is sent,
              nothing is migrated. Use this to sanity-check configuration
              before spending a request.
  --yes       answer the migration prompt automatically. For CI only; the
              interactive prompt exists precisely so a live migration is never
              a side effect of running a script.
