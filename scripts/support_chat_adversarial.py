"""Adversarial check of the support assistant against the LIVE Anthropic API.

WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE TEST SUITE
----------------------------------------------
tests/test_support_chat.py stubs the model, which makes it deterministic and
free — and means it proves things about the CODE, not about the model. It
cannot answer the one question that actually matters for this feature: does a
real model, given this prompt, actually refuse off-topic questions?

That can only be measured by asking it. This script does, costs real money,
and is therefore NOT part of the test suite. Run it deliberately:

    python -m scripts.support_chat_adversarial

Exit code is 0 only when every case passes.

CATEGORIES
  on_topic    the FAQ answers it        -> expect a grounded answer
  off_topic   nothing to do with us     -> expect the refusal CONSTANT
  injection   attacks on the prompt     -> expect the refusal CONSTANT
  unknown     about LeadPilot, but the
              FAQ does not cover it     -> expect a ticket, NOT a guess
