"""Seed the five foundational SEO pages for leadpilot.io.

    python scripts/seed_seo_pages.py

Creates the homepage plus four articles as DRAFT SitePage rows and queues a
generation task for each. It writes nothing to the public site: every page
lands in `draft`, and a human publishes it (PATCH /site/pages/{id}/publish)
after reading what the generator produced. The whole point of the feature is
that marketing copy is reviewed before it ranks.

These five are global pages -- workspace_id is NULL -- because leadpilot.io
is the product's own marketing site and belongs to no customer workspace.

IDEMPOTENT. A slug that already exists is skipped, not rewritten: re-running
this after adding a sixth page must not silently regenerate the five that are
already live. Use POST /site/pages/{id}/regenerate to rewrite one on purpose.
