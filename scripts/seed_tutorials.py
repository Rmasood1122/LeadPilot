"""Seed the nine Learn LeadPilot tutorials into `tutorial_catalogue`.

    python scripts/seed_tutorials.py

Writes to whatever DATABASE_URL points at. There is no separate "local"
database behind this -- check .env before running it.

IDEMPOTENT. A tutorial whose title OR slug already exists is skipped, never
rewritten: once Ahmad has added a real youtube_id through the admin UI,
re-running this must not blank it again.

HOW THE BRIEF MAPS ONTO THE REAL SCHEMA (app/db/models.py TutorialCatalogue)
  duration_minutes -> duration_seconds (x 60)
  order            -> sort_order. The API orders by level first, so a global
                      1-9 still sorts correctly inside each level.
  video_url        -> youtube_id = None. The column holds the 11-character id,
                      not an embed URL (String(32) -- an embed URL does not
                      fit), and a fake id makes VideoPlayer render YouTube's
                      own "Video unavailable" error. NULL renders the honest
                      "not published yet" panel instead. See
                      scripts/TUTORIAL_VIDEO_URLS.md for adding real ids.
  slug             -> fixed below, not derived from the title. Slugs are
                      permanent: tutorial_progress points at them by string, so
                      renaming one orphans every user's progress.

is_published = True. Migration 0018 seeds drafts on purpose, but these nine
exist to fill the Learn tab now, with videos to follow. The rows migration
0018 created are left untouched and stay unpublished.
