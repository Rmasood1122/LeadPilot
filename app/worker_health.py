"""Tiny HTTP surface so Render's FREE tier will host the Celery worker.

Render's free plan has no background-worker service type — only Web Services,
which must bind to $PORT and answer HTTP. So the worker container runs a
minimal health server alongside the Celery processes purely to qualify. It
serves no application traffic: exactly one route, no database, no auth.

DO NOT mount the real API (app.main) here. That would publish all ~97 routes on
a second public origin whose CORS, rate limits and admin surface nobody
reasoned about.

WHY THIS REPORTS REAL LIVENESS INSTEAD OF ALWAYS 200
    The obvious version returns 200 unconditionally. That creates precisely the
    failure this project keeps hitting: the Celery worker dies, the HTTP server
    happily keeps answering, Render's health check stays green, and tasks pile
    up unconsumed with no error anywhere. (See CLAUDE_CODE_HANDOFF.md session
    update 9 — the queue-routing outage had the same shape: everything looked
    healthy while nothing was consumed.)

    So /health checks that the supervised child processes are actually alive
    and returns 503 if they are not, which makes Render restart the service.
    A crashed worker becomes a visible restart rather than silent nothing.

The PIDs come from the entrypoint script via WORKER_PID_FILE / BEAT_PID_FILE.
When those are unset — running this module by hand — the checks are skipped
rather than failing, so local use is not booby-trapped.

    THIS EXISTS BECAUSE PID CHECKS WERE NOT ENOUGH. On 2026-08-20 both Celery
    processes were alive and this endpoint reported {"worker":"ok","beat":"ok"}
    while the beat heartbeat was silently failing on every tick — so the API's
    /health sat at "no heartbeat key found" and nothing anywhere said why.

    The cause is a trap worth naming: Celery uses CELERY_BROKER_URL, but
    app/core/redis_client.py uses REDIS_URL, and settings.redis_url has a
    NON-EMPTY default of redis://localhost:6379/0. So an unset REDIS_URL does
    not fail — it quietly points at a localhost Redis that does not exist
    inside the container. Celery keeps working (different variable), beat keeps
    scheduling, and only the heartbeat write dies.

    Reporting it here makes the worker's own health endpoint tell the truth,
