"""Region-aware compliance, recorded per send (Feature Group 9).

For every outreach send -- and every send the engine refused on compliance
grounds -- one compliance_audit_log row records the recipient's region (from
app/services/compliance_region.py), the regime that applies, the checks that
were made and the decision. It is the answer to "on what basis did you
email this person?", written at the moment the decision was made.

Regimes and what LeadPilot does about each:
  US  CAN-SPAM   unsubscribe link + sender identity in every email; honoured
                 immediately (the law allows 10 business days)
  CA  CASL       B2B cold email relies on IMPLIED consent (a published
                 business address and a message relevant to the role).
                 LeadPilot cannot verify that; the audit records
                 "implied_consent_assumed" and the footer states the sender
                 and the unsubscribe route
  EU  GDPR       legitimate interest for B2B outreach; every email carries a
                 notice of the right to object
  UK  UK GDPR /  as EU; corporate subscribers may be emailed under PECR
      PECR
  SG  PDPA       email with an unsubscribe route; phone and SMS additionally
                 need the national Do-Not-Call check, which LeadPilot does NOT
                 perform (recorded)
  AU/NZ          inferred consent + identification + unsubscribe
Unknown region: the strictest common baseline (identification, unsubscribe)
is applied and the row says the region was unknown.

None of this is legal advice; it is a record of what was checked.
