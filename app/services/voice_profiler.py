"""Feature 3 — founder voice cloning.

Reads up to 20 of the LeadPilot client's own LinkedIn posts and extracts HOW
they write, as a small set of closed-vocabulary dimensions. Every outgoing
message for that product is then written in their voice instead of a template
voice.

RELATIONSHIP TO app/services/style_profile.py. That module profiles a USER
from writing samples they paste, and is applied to every channel across their
whole account. This one profiles a PRODUCT from LinkedIn posts, and is applied
to that product's outreach. They compose rather than compete: style_profile
goes in the SYSTEM prompt ("write like this person"), the voice profile is
appended to the step BRIEF ("and specifically, here is their voice"). A user
with both gets both, which is the same instruction twice, not two conflicting
ones.

WHY CLOSED VOCABULARIES. Every dimension below has a fixed set of legal
values. A free-text "describe their style" field produces a different
description every run, which then produces differently-worded outreach every
run for no reason the founder asked for. Closed values make the profile
stable, diffable, and something a UI can render as a form the user can
correct.

THE POSTS THEMSELVES NEVER REACH AN OUTREACH PROMPT. Only the extracted
dimensions do. A profile built from a post about the founder's divorce must
not be able to put that post in front of a prospect.
