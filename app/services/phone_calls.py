"""Feature Group 6 — AI cold calls: consent, scripts, voicemail, results.

READ THIS BEFORE ENABLING THE CHANNEL
Since the FCC's February 2024 declaratory ruling, AI-generated voices are an
"artificial or prerecorded voice" under the US Telephone Consumer Protection
Act. Calling a US mobile number with one -- or dropping a prerecorded
voicemail on it -- needs the called party's PRIOR EXPRESS CONSENT (written
consent for telemarketing). Other jurisdictions have their own rules. This
module therefore:

  * keeps the channel OFF until an admin enables it (`phone_calling_enabled`);
  * refuses to call a lead with no recorded consent (`phone_consent_at`) while
    `phone_require_consent` is on -- the default -- skipping the step so the
    sequence continues, exactly as a WhatsApp step skips a lead with no
    opt-in;
  * opens every call with a disclosure that the caller is an AI assistant
    calling on the user's behalf, and honours a stop request by suppressing
    the number;
  * calls only inside the lead's local send window (weekdays, 9-17 by
    default) and within a per-user daily call limit.

It does NOT check national Do-Not-Call registries. That is the operator's
obligation before enabling the channel, and the admin setting says so.

WHAT A CALL IS MADE OF
  script     Claude writes it per lead from the step brief, the strategy's
             messaging research, the ICP and the lead's own posts and news,
             in the sender's voice: a first line (with the AI disclosure),
             the objective, talking points, objection handling, questions and
             a close -- plus a short personalised VOICEMAIL in the same call.
  voicemail  If ElevenLabs is configured, the voicemail is also rendered to
             audio (TTS) and hosted, so the user can hear exactly what was
             left. The provider detects a machine and speaks the voicemail in
             the configured ElevenLabs voice.
  result     The provider's end-of-call webhook stores recording, duration,
             transcript and ended reason. A voicemail ends as
             `voicemail_dropped`. A conversation is analysed by Claude
             (outcome, objections, interest signals, next step) on the
             outreach queue -- never inline in the webhook.

ROUTING A RESULT
  interested / not_interested   a human engaged: the sequence stops, like a
                                reply; interested also notifies (push/Slack)
  voicemail / no answer         the sequence continues
  a stop request in the call    number suppressed + sequence stopped
