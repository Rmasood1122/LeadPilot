"""Tutorial catalogue access + badge definitions.

WHERE THE CATALOGUE LIVES
-------------------------
In the DATABASE, table `tutorial_catalogue` (migration 0018). It used to live
in this file as a constant; that was reversed on purpose so a video can be
added through the admin UI with no deploy.

What remains here:

  SEED_CATALOGUE   the original nine entries. Migration 0018 inserts them and
                   NOTHING READS THEM AT RUNTIME. They stay so a fresh database
                   seeds identically and the editorial text is reviewable in
                   git rather than only in production rows.

  LEVELS / BADGES  structural, not editorial. Levels are a closed set the UI
                   lays out around, and badges are derived rules, not content
                   -- neither is something an admin should be able to invent
                   from a form.

  query helpers    list_tutorials / get_tutorial / slugs_for_level, all taking
                   a Session.

PUBLISHED VS NOT
Every user-facing query filters is_published. Admin queries do not. That
single distinction is why the helpers take an explicit `include_unpublished`
flag rather than inferring it: a default that silently leaked drafts to users
would be invisible until someone noticed an unfinished tutorial in the Learn
tab.

SLUGS ARE STILL PERMANENT
tutorial_progress rows reference the catalogue by slug with no foreign key
(see migration 0018 for why). Renaming a slug orphans progress, so the admin
API refuses to change one.
