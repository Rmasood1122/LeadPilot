"""Positive reply classification (Part 1, Feature 1).

There are now four questions asked of every inbound reply, and they are
deliberately separate columns because each drives something different:

  `classification`      how does the ENGINE route this? (stop, pause, suppress)
  `reply_category`      what does the HUMAN do next? (draft + next action)
  `authenticity_kind`   is a real person on the other end?
  `intent_label`        WAS THIS REPLY POSITIVE?   <- this module

The fifth question nobody could answer before: "of the replies this campaign
got, how many were actually good?" A raw reply rate counts "unsubscribe me"
and "wrong person" as wins. The positive reply rate does not, and it sits
BESIDE the raw rate rather than replacing it -- a campaign with a high reply
rate and a low positive rate is a different problem from one with neither.

LABELS
  interested    wants to talk, asks to book, asks for pricing/details
  neutral       acknowledges, forwards, asks an unrelated question, or is a
                machine (bounce / out-of-office / auto-responder)
  objection     pushes back -- price, timing-as-excuse, incumbent, "not for us"
  not_now       genuinely interested LATER ("circle back in Q2", "after the
                reorg"); feeds the re-engagement memory (Feature 7)
  unsubscribe   asks to stop being contacted, in any wording

HOW. A rules pass first, a model call only when the rules are not certain:
  * `classification == "unsubscribe_request"` -> unsubscribe, confidence 1.0.
    The routing classifier already suppressed the contact; disagreeing with
    it here would report a suppression as a neutral reply.
  * bounce / out_of_office / automated_response -> neutral, confidence 1.0,
    and `machine_reply()` is True so the metric can exclude them.
  * anything else -> one structured Claude call returning
    {label, confidence, reason}.
A failed or unparseable model call leaves the reply UNCLASSIFIED rather than
guessing, because a guessed label would silently move a headline metric.
