"""Per-mailbox deliverability health, with auto-throttle (Part 1, Feature 4).

WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE deliverability.py. That module scores a sending
DOMAIN: SPF/DKIM/DMARC, blocklists, the account's overall bounce rate. Useful,
but the domain is the wrong grain for acting on. Two mailboxes on one domain
can have very different reputations -- one warmed for a year, one connected
last week and already generating complaints -- and slowing the whole domain
punishes the good one. This module scores the MAILBOX and throttles exactly
the mailbox that is in trouble.

THE FOUR INPUTS
  auth       SPF / DKIM / DMARC for the mailbox's domain (reused verbatim
             from deliverability.dns_auth -- one implementation of the DNS
             reading, not two that can disagree)
  complaints the complaint rate over the window (see the honesty note below)
  bounces    the bounce rate over the window, counted for THIS mailbox
  volume     sends today and over 7 days, against the mailbox's daily cap --
             a mailbox suddenly sending four times its recent average is the
             single most reliable precursor of a reputation problem

HONESTY ABOUT THE COMPLAINT RATE. LeadPilot has no feedback-loop (FBL) or
Postmaster Tools integration, so a true "marked as spam" signal is not
available. `complaint_rate` is a documented PROXY: unsubscribes plus replies
asking to stop, over sends in the window. It correlates with complaints and it
is honest about what it is -- `complaint_source` says "proxy" in every payload,
and the UI prints it. When an FBL is connected later, only `complaint_rate`
and that label change; the score, the thresholds and the gate do not.

WHAT HAPPENS TO A BAD MAILBOX
  score >= THROTTLE_BELOW      healthy    -- normal cap
  PAUSE_BELOW <= score < ...   throttled  -- cap cut to THROTTLE_FRACTION of
                                            the ramped allowance, minimum
                                            MIN_THROTTLE_CAP. Sending slows;
                                            nothing is dropped.
  score < PAUSE_BELOW          paused     -- no sends from this mailbox.
                                            Messages are DEFERRED, never
                                            cancelled, so nothing is lost.

Resuming a paused mailbox is a HUMAN decision (`resume()`), like the bounce
pause and the blacklist pause before it: a refresh that happens to score
higher must not quietly restart sending from a mailbox that burned.
