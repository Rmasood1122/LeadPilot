"""Fit / Problem / Timing / Access scoring (Part 1, Feature 2).

WHY FOUR NUMBERS AND NOT ONE
`ai_booking_likelihood` (FG1) answers "will they book?" in a single 0-100.
That number is useful and unchanged, but it erases the difference between the
four ways a prospect can be wrong, and those four want opposite actions:

  FIT      Are they the kind of company and person this offer is for?
           Wrong fit -> do not contact. No amount of timing rescues it.
  PROBLEM  Is there evidence they HAVE the problem we solve?
           No evidence -> the message has no hook; go find one first.
  TIMING   Is something happening right now that makes this the moment?
           No timing -> contact them, but expect a "not now" (and Feature 7
           will schedule the return trip).
  ACCESS   Can we actually reach this person, on a channel they answer?
           No access -> the other three do not matter yet; fix the route.

TWO LAYERS, same shape as lead_scoring.py:
  1. A deterministic BASELINE per dimension, computed from data we hold, with
     the evidence recorded as a list of short signal strings. This is what
     makes a score explainable (Feature 12 renders exactly these) and what
     survives a model outage.
  2. ONE Claude call per batch that writes a human sentence per dimension and
     may move each baseline by at most +/-MAX_ADJUSTMENT points, grounded in
     the data it was given. The clamp is enforced HERE, not asked for in the
     prompt.

NOTHING IS INVENTED. A dimension with no evidence scores its documented
neutral baseline and says so ("no visible problem signal"), rather than
borrowing confidence from another dimension.
