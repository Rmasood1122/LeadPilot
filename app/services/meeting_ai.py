"""Turn a transcript and a human's scrappy notes into a usable meeting record.

Goes through app/services/anthropic_client.py::get_client() like every other
model call in this codebase. Not because a second client would be hard to
write, but because retries, model selection, the truncation guard and the
single monkeypatch point the test suite hangs off all live there -- a
`anthropic.Anthropic(...)` here would quietly opt this feature out of all four.

WHAT THIS RETURNS, AND WHY IT NEVER RAISES ON A BAD ANSWER
`generate_meeting_summary` always returns the five-key dict its callers store,
with empty values on failure, and reports what happened in `ok`/`error`. The
alternative -- raising -- would mean a model hiccup at the end of a call loses
the summary AND leaves the meeting stuck in `in_progress`, because the endpoint
that generates the summary is the same one that completes the meeting. The
transcript and the user's own notes are already saved; a missing summary is a
button to press again, not lost work.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
It does not invent action items. The system prompt says so explicitly and the
sanitiser below drops anything that is not a non-empty string, because an
action item is a thing a human is about to be told they committed to. The same
rule the outreach personalizer follows for pain signals applies here: if it is
not in the transcript or the notes, it does not go in the summary.
