"""Feature Group 1 — the multi-model consensus engine.

WHAT RUNS TWICE, AND WHY ONLY THAT
The strategy document is assembled from each phase's SYNTHESIS step (step 9 of
every phase -- see pipeline/engine.py::_assemble). Those eight outputs per
pipeline are the document; the other 64 are research that feeds them. So
consensus runs on the synthesis steps only: GPT-4o answers the identical system
prompt and research brief in parallel with Claude, and every uncertain zone
maps onto a section a reader actually sees. Running both models on all 144
steps would triple the cost of a strategy to flag disagreements in text nobody
reads.

CLAUDE STAYS CANONICAL
Claude's answer is written to research_steps and assembled into the document
exactly as before; GPT-4o's is stored beside it (strategy_model_outputs). The
consensus layer adds information -- it never replaces a section with the other
model's text, because "the second model said something different" is a reason
for a human to look, not evidence the first one was wrong.

HOW A DISAGREEMENT IS DECIDED
A Claude "consensus judge" compares the two answers with the models ANONYMISED
as Strategist A and Strategist B (the judge is Claude; telling it which answer
was its own invites it to side with itself). It is told to ignore wording,
ordering, emphasis and depth, and to report only different recommendations,
contradictory facts or figures, or a different target segment, channel or
price. Only medium/high severity becomes an uncertain zone. The TF-IDF cosine
of the two outputs is stored alongside as a second, model-free signal.

FAILURE NEVER BLOCKS A STRATEGY
If OpenAI errors, times out or is not configured, the step completes on
Claude's answer alone and the failure is recorded; the strategy's
consensus_status becomes "partial". If the judge fails, no zones are written
for that step. Claude failing still raises, exactly as it did without
consensus, so the pipeline's retry/resume semantics are unchanged.
