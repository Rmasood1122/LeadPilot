"""The compliance and consent layer (Part 1, Feature 9).

WHAT WAS ALREADY THERE, and is unchanged:
  * `compliance_region.py` decides which regime a recipient falls under, from
    their country and failing that their timezone;
  * `compliance_audit.py` writes one row per send saying what was checked and
    on what legal basis;
  * `sequence_engine.compliance_footer` puts the sender identity and the
    unsubscribe link in every email;
  * `lead_tasks.is_suppressed` checks email, phone AND LinkedIn on every send.

WHAT THIS MODULE ADDS, and why each piece exists:

1. ONE SUPPRESSION ACT THAT COVERS EVERY CHANNEL, INCLUDING WHATSAPP.
   `unsubscribe_lead` suppressed email, phone and LinkedIn but left
   `whatsapp_opted_in` alone -- so someone who unsubscribed by email could
   still be messaged on WhatsApp. "Stop contacting me" is a single
   instruction about a person, not a per-channel preference, and it is now
   applied as one.

2. A CONSENT LEDGER. `compliance_audit_log` answers "on what basis did you
   send this?". Nothing answered "when did they tell you to stop, and what
   did you do about it?" -- which is the question a regulator, and a prospect
   writing an angry second email, actually asks.

3. REQUIREMENTS PER REGION AND CHANNEL, stated once. What each regime demands
   was previously spread between a footer builder, a region module and a
   comment. `requirements_for()` puts it in one place that the send path, the
   UI and the tests all read, so they cannot drift.

NONE OF THIS IS LEGAL ADVICE. It is a record of what was checked and what was
done, which is a different and more useful thing.
