"""Feature 2 — reply intelligence engine.

Every inbound reply gets a second read by Claude that answers a question the
M3 classifier (app/services/reply_classification.py) deliberately does not:
not "how does the system route this?" but "what does the HUMAN do next?".

    BUYING_SIGNAL   interested, ready for the product conversation
                    -> line the enrollment up at step 3
    OBJECTION       a specific concern was raised
                    -> draft an answer to THAT concern
    NOT_NOW         timing, not rejection
                    -> come back on a date (30 days by default, editable)
    WRONG_PERSON    referred on, or confirmed not the buyer
                    -> draft a referral request

THE HUMAN IS NEVER BYPASSED. This module writes a DRAFT onto the reply row.
Nothing here sends anything, and nothing here restarts a stopped sequence: a
BUYING_SIGNAL moves the enrollment's `current_step` so the next step to render
is step 3, but leaves its STATUS exactly as the reply handler set it. A person
still has to act. That is the whole design -- an outbound system that answers
humans by itself is one bad classification away from an apology.

BANNED WORDS. The eight words in BANNED_WORDS are the ones that make a
prospect close the tab. A draft containing any of them is regenerated once
with the offenders named; if the second attempt still uses them, the draft
degrades to the category's neutral fallback rather than shipping copy that
reads like every other cold email in the inbox.
