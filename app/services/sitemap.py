"""Sitemap and robots.txt for the LeadPilot marketing site.

Serves the LIVE versions of the two files Google reads first. The static
export (app/services/website_builder.py::export_static_site) writes its own
copies alongside the exported pages; these two functions are what
GET /site/sitemap.xml and GET /site/robots.txt return, so a page published a
minute ago is discoverable before anyone runs an export.

THE THREE STATIC URLS are the pages that exist on the marketing site
independently of this database — the front door, how-it-works and pricing.
They are listed first and unconditionally: a sitemap that omits the homepage
because nobody has created a SitePage row for it is worse than no sitemap.
A published page whose slug collides with one of them is not listed twice.
