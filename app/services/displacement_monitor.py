"""Feature 4 — competitor displacement alerts.

Watches the LinkedIn posts of every lead already in the CRM, at any status, for
the moment they say in public that their current approach is not working. When
one does, it writes an alert carrying the evidence and a DM that references
that specific post.

WHY THIS BEATS COLD OUTREACH. A lead who has just posted "cold email is not
working for us" has pre-qualified themselves and told you the opening line. The
whole feature exists to make the gap between that post and a relevant message
minutes instead of never.

THREE TRIGGER GROUPS, ONE MATCH IS ENOUGH (see TRIGGER_GROUPS). Competitor
tool names are matched on word boundaries so "Clay" does not fire on
"declaim"; the pain phrases are matched as substrings because they are already
specific enough that a false positive is nearly impossible.

DEDUPLICATION AND EXPIRY. One alert per lead per DEDUP_DAYS (14), so a founder
who posts about the same frustration three times in a week is not three alerts.
Each alert is stale after EXPIRY_DAYS (7): a "saw your post" DM sent two weeks
later reads worse than no DM at all.

THE DM IS A DRAFT. Nothing here sends. The alert lands in a list a human reads.
