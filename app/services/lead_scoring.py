"""Feature Group 1 — predictive lead scoring (`ai_booking_likelihood`, 0-100).

TWO LAYERS, AND WHY
1. FACTORS, computed deterministically from data we hold: role seniority,
   industry match against the ICP, email verification status, company
   signals (recent funding, size in the ICP's range), and the playbook's
   observed booking rate for this strategy's pattern. Weighted into a
   heuristic baseline.
2. CLAUDE reads the factors and the lead, in batches, and may move the
   baseline by at most +/-20 points with a one-sentence reason grounded in
   the data. The clamp is enforced HERE, not just asked for in the prompt.

The model adds judgement the weights cannot ("Head of Ops at a 30-person
contractor is the actual buyer for this offer"); the baseline keeps a score
explainable and stops a model hiccup from turning a strong lead into a 5. If
the model call fails, every lead in the batch keeps its heuristic score and is
marked `method: heuristic` -- scoring degrades, it never blocks sourcing.

WHERE IT RUNS
After a sourcing batch finalizes (app/workers/lead_tasks.py), on the leads that
survived verification, and on demand from the API (Rescore).
