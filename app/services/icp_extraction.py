# Strategy.pattern_key is documented as "SHA-256 of sorted canonical ICP/tactic
# JSON", and pattern_key is what links a strategy to its playbook_scores rows.
# Both halves therefore have to be LOW CARDINALITY: the whole point of the
# playbook is aggregating outcomes ACROSS strategies that share a pattern, and
# a key that is unique per strategy buckets nothing and learns nothing.
#
# That rules out hashing the Phase 5/8 research directly - those steps are
# prompted for "clear markdown, 300-600 words", so every strategy's tactic
# prose is unique. The tactic half is instead a small CLOSED vocabulary,
# extracted once and filtered to the allowed values, so an unexpected answer
# from the model degrades to "unknown" (dropped) rather than minting a new
# bucket.
