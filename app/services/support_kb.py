"""The support knowledge base — the ONLY thing the AI is allowed to answer from.

WHY A CURATED FAQ AND NOT RAG OR "THE MODEL JUST KNOWS"
------------------------------------------------------
A support bot that answers from the model's own knowledge invents features.
It will confidently describe a LinkedIn automation LeadPilot does not have, or
quote a price nobody set, and the user believes it because it sounds like the
product's own voice. That is worse than no chat at all: it generates support
load instead of absorbing it, and it can make promises the product cannot keep.

So the answers below are WRITTEN BY A HUMAN and the model's job is narrowed to
one thing: pick the relevant entries and phrase them for this particular
question. It may compress, reorder and combine. It may not add facts.

CHANGING THE CONTENT
--------------------
Edit the entries here. No migration, no SQL, no deploy step beyond the normal
one — same reasoning as app/services/tutorials.py. `id` values are referenced
in stored chat messages (`faq_ids`) for auditing which answer was used, so
treat them as permanent: change text freely, change ids never.
