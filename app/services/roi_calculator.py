"""Feature 5 — client ROI dashboard.

What LeadPilot actually produced for the founder using it, in six numbers they
would recognise as their own business results rather than as software metrics.

    meetings_booked      leads that got past step 3 and booked
    pipeline_value       money sitting in open + won deals RIGHT NOW
    messages_sent        every outgoing message, every channel
    reply_rate           unique leads who replied / leads contacted
    time_saved_hours     messages x 15 min + meetings x 90 min
    revenue_attributed   money from leads that closed won

FLOW VS STOCK -- READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING A DATE FILTER. Four of the six are
FLOWS and are strictly bounded by the date range: messages_sent, reply_rate,
meetings_booked, revenue_attributed. `pipeline_value` is a STOCK -- "what is in
the pipeline right now" -- and is deliberately NOT date-filtered, because the
value of the open pipeline on a range that ended last month is not a number any
founder has ever wanted. The API labels it as such so the two are never read as
the same kind of thing.

WHY leads.status AND NOT deals. app/services/revenue_analytics.py already
reports on the `deals` table with its own currencies and close dates; that is
the finance view. This is the retention artefact -- the proof card a founder
forwards to a peer -- and it reads the lead statuses the founder themselves
drags around the CRM board, which is the pipeline they believe in. The two can
disagree, and when they do the deals table is right about money and this is
right about what the founder thinks they have.

MONEY IS Decimal END TO END. Nothing here converts to float. A proof card that
disagrees with the CRM by a cent is a proof card that loses an argument.
