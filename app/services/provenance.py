"""Data provenance tags (Part 1, Feature 10).

WHY. Every field on a prospect arrives from somewhere, and those somewheres are
not equally trustworthy. A title typed by a human is not a title Apollo guessed
from a job posting. An email Hunter marked deliverable is not one a pattern
generator built from a first name and a domain. A tech stack scraped from a
careers page is not one inferred from a logo.

Today all of them render identically, and a person deciding whether to write
"I saw you're hiring three more inspectors" has no way to know whether that
came from the company's own job board or from a guess. This records, per field,
WHERE IT CAME FROM, HOW CONFIDENT that source is, and WHEN it was observed.

THE CONFIDENCE IS THE SOURCE'S, NOT A MODEL'S. Each source has a documented
default confidence based on what that source actually is -- a verified email is
0.95 because a verification provider said the mailbox accepts mail, an inferred
field is 0.35 because nobody observed it. A caller may override it with
something they know better, but nothing here invents a number.

AGE MATTERS AS MUCH AS SOURCE. A headcount from Apollo is good data; a headcount
from Apollo eighteen months ago is a different claim. `staleness` is reported
beside confidence, and the two are deliberately kept separate rather than
multiplied into one score that hides which is the problem.
