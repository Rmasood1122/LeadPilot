"""The single gateway for every transactional email LeadPilot sends.

Before Feature 1 this codebase had NO way to send a system email at all.
app/integrations/gmail.py sends on behalf of a *customer's* connected Gmail
account as part of outreach; it is not, and must not become, the transport for
"here is your verification link" — that mail has to go out before the user has
connected anything, and it must come from LeadPilot's own domain.

So: one function, `send_email`, and four interchangeable transports selected by
the EMAIL_PROVIDER setting.

    resend   HTTPS POST to api.resend.com.        Production.
    smtp     Plain SMTP.                          Mailtrap sandbox locally,
                                                  any relay in production.
    console  Logs the whole message, sends none.  Local dev with no creds.
    memory   Appends to SENT_MESSAGES, sends none. The test suite asserts on it.

WHY THE PROVIDER IS EXPLICIT AND NOT INFERRED
A tempting design is "use Resend if RESEND_API_KEY is set, else log". That
fails silently in exactly the case that matters: a production deploy where the
key is missing or the variable name is misspelled keeps booting, keeps
answering health checks, and writes every user's verification link to a log
file nobody reads. Naming the transport means a misconfigured production
process raises at send time with a message that says which variable is wrong.

FAILURE POLICY
send_email raises EmailSendError on any transport failure. Callers decide
whether that is fatal. Signup deliberately does NOT let it be fatal — see
app/api/auth.py — because an account that was created and then 500'd because
the mail relay was briefly down is worse than an account that exists and needs
a resend click.
