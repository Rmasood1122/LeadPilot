notifications.py — ClientHunter Enterprise (M7 Chunk 3)

Firebase Cloud Messaging notification service.

Design decisions:
  • Lazy Firebase init: only initialises on first use; raises clear error if
    FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH is not set. This lets the backend start normally
    even if Firebase is not configured (notifications are a feature, not a
    critical-path requirement for existing M1–M6 functionality).
  • Invalid tokens are marked is_valid=False in device_tokens rather than
    deleted immediately — keeps the audit trail.
  • Deep link URLs are built from constants in deeplinks.ts (documented inline);
    the backend uses the same pattern to ensure client and server agree.
  • Every notification event is logged to the outcomes table.

Wiring into existing services:
  This file provides functions. Call them AFTER the relevant state change
  in existing service code. Do not restructure existing services — just add
  one call at the end of the relevant function. The call sites are marked
  with exact patterns below.

  WIRE IN app/services/pipeline.py (strategy complete / verification fail):
    from app.services.notifications import notify_strategy_ready, notify_strategy_needs_review
    # After marking strategy status = 'complete':
    await notify_strategy_ready(user_id=strategy.user_id, strategy_id=strategy.id)
    # After a verification pass FAIL with no remaining retries:
    await notify_strategy_needs_review(user_id=strategy.user_id, strategy_id=strategy.id)

  WIRE IN app/api/webhooks.py (Calendly meeting booked):
    from app.services.notifications import notify_meeting_booked
    # Inside the Calendly webhook handler, after updating lead status:
    await notify_meeting_booked(user_id=..., lead_id=..., attendee_name=event_name)

  WIRE IN app/services/outreach.py (new reply received):
    from app.services.notifications import notify_new_reply
    # After inserting a new 'replied' outcome event:
    await notify_new_reply(user_id=..., lead_id=..., company=lead.company)

  WIRE IN app/api/campaigns.py (campaign auto-paused on bounce):
    from app.services.notifications import notify_campaign_paused
    await notify_campaign_paused(user_id=..., campaign_id=...)

  WIRE IN app/services/whatsapp.py (template status webhook from Meta):
    from app.services.notifications import notify_whatsapp_template_status
    await notify_whatsapp_template_status(user_id=..., template_name=..., approved=True/False)

    Every trigger point for these notifications is ordinary synchronous code -
    the verification loop, the reply router, the bounce-rate check - but two of
    them (the Calendly and WhatsApp webhook handlers) are `async def` while
    still holding a SYNC Session. The established convention in this codebase
    is `try: asyncio.run(NotificationService.send_*(...)) except: log.warning`
    (see core/circuit_breaker.py and workers/webhook_tasks.py), and bare
    asyncio.run() raises RuntimeError inside a running loop - so copying that
    line into the webhook handlers would have silently swallowed every
    notification they tried to send. This helper handles both cases and is the
    ONLY thing the six call sites use, so a wrong trigger point or a changed
    convention is a one-line fix rather than six.

    Failure is logged and dropped: a push notification must never break the
    business operation that triggered it (the same contract
    NotificationService documents).

    IMPORTANT: do not close over the caller's Session in `coro`. In the
    running-loop branch the coroutine executes on a WORKER THREAD, and a
    SQLAlchemy Session is not thread-safe. Every call site therefore passes
    db=None and lets send_to_user open its own short-lived session (which is
