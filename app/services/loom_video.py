"""Feature Group 2 — personalised Loom video for high-likelihood leads.

WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT DO, STATED PLAINLY
Loom has no API that records a video on someone's behalf -- a person has to
record it. So "auto-generate a video" means what it honestly can:

  1. When a lead's ai_booking_likelihood rises above `loom_score_threshold`
     (default 75), a personalised RECORDING SCRIPT is written for the user
     (Claude, from the lead's profile, posts and company news) and the lead is
     marked `suggested`. The user gets one notification per scoring batch, not
     one per lead.
  2. The user records it in Loom and pastes the share link on the lead page.
     The lead is marked `recorded`.
  3. Sequence step 2 for that lead then includes a call to action linking to
     a LeadPilot-hosted page -- /v?t=<token> -- pre-populated with the lead's
     first name and company, which embeds the video.

A step 2 that renders before a video exists gets NO video CTA. Sending a link
to a page with nothing on it would be worse than sending no link.

The page token is Fernet-encrypted {lead_id, purpose} (same scheme as the
unsubscribe token), so it cannot be forged or enumerated, and the public
endpoint behind it returns only a first name, a company name and the embed id.
