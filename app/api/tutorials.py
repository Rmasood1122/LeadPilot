"""Learn LeadPilot — the tutorial section (Feature 2).

GET    /tutorials                      catalogue + this user's progress, with
                                       optional ?q= search and ?level= filter
GET    /tutorials/{slug}               one tutorial + progress
PUT    /tutorials/{slug}/progress      report a playback position
POST   /tutorials/{slug}/complete      mark finished explicitly
DELETE /tutorials/{slug}/progress      reset one video to not-started

Every route is user-scoped through get_current_user, so progress is PRIVATE
per user by construction -- there is no route here that can read another
user's rows, not even for an admin. Admins get aggregate completion counts
from GET /admin/tutorials/completions, which returns numbers only and never
names a video a specific person watched.

The catalogue lives in the `tutorial_catalogue` table (migration 0018) and is
managed from /admin/tutorials. EVERY query on this router filters
is_published, so a draft tutorial is invisible here -- an unpublished slug is
a 404 exactly like a slug that does not exist, which is what stops an admin
accidentally previewing work-in-progress to users through a shared URL.
