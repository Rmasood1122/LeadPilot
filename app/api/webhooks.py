"""Webhooks — Calendly booking events (M3 Chunk 5).

invitee.created  -> lead meeting_booked, sequences stop, `booked` outcome
invitee.canceled -> lead back to replied, event recorded
Deliveries are signature-verified and idempotent (Calendly retries).

NOTE FOR FEATURE 2 (reply intelligence). This module handles BOOKINGS; it
never creates an InboundReply, so there is nothing here to classify. The
`process_inbound_reply` dispatch lives at the three places that actually
create one:
    app/workers/outreach_tasks.py   the Gmail reply poller
    app/api/linkedin.py             the Unipile message_received webhook
    app/api/webhooks_whatsapp.py    the WhatsApp inbound webhook
