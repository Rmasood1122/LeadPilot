# matches both — and it made the fix loop oscillate between the two values until
# it exhausted its retries.

# Observed in the 2026-08-19 Phase C run: Phase 1 estimated "$2,500-$7,500/mo",
# Phase 2 finalised "$3,000 Foundation / $5,500 Growth". The judge failed the
# document for using either value, then for using both.
#
# This rule is stated to the judge explicitly rather than left to per-call
# inference, so the behaviour is deterministic across runs.
PRECEDENCE_RULE = """SOURCE-OF-TRUTH PRECEDENCE (apply before judging):

The supporting context is ordered research from a staged funnel. Later phases
REFINE and SUPERSEDE earlier ones. Each block is labelled with its phase number.

1. When two phases give different values for the same fact (a price, a budget,
   a range, a headcount, a date), the HIGHEST-NUMBERED phase is authoritative.
   The earlier value is a superseded working estimate, NOT a contradiction.
2. A strategy document that states the latest value is CORRECT. Do not fail it
   for disagreeing with an earlier phase, and do not ask for the earlier value
   to be restored.
3. Do not require the document to cite, footnote or reconcile the superseded
   value. Silently using the latest value is the expected behaviour.
4. Only treat differing values as a genuine defect when they come from the SAME
   phase, or when the document states a value that appears in NO phase, or when
   this criterion is specifically about consistency between two named documents.

Judge the document against the criterion using the authoritative values only."""
