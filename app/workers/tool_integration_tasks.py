"""Celery tasks for tool integrations (routed to the `default` queue).

Task 1: audit_draft_with_aegisaudit
  Audits an AI-generated draft before sending. Returns a pass/flag/block
  decision. Fails OPEN — an optional quality tool must never stop outreach.

Task 2: signalforge_research_lead
  On demand — run research for a prospect that ALREADY exists in the user's
  SIGNALFORGE instance (research also writes a REVIEW_REQUIRED draft), and
  return the ICP score and that draft. It never creates the prospect (that
  would need the WRITE scope, which LeadPilot's key does not hold) and never
  generates a second draft: research already made one.

There is no PostIQ task: PostIQ exposes no API to read or trigger its drafts
(see app/integrations/postiq.py).

Arguments arrive JSON-serialised, so UUIDs come in as strings.
