"""The `notifications` queue: fan-out of event_bus events off the request path.

WHY A QUEUE OF ITS OWN
Push, Slack and webhook fan-out are small, latency-sensitive jobs -- a
reminder that arrives twenty minutes late is a reminder for a call already in
progress. On `default` they would queue behind the learning loop; on
`pipeline` behind a 144-step strategy build. A dedicated queue with its own
worker concurrency keeps them prompt whatever else the system is doing.

enqueue_event() is what request handlers call. If the broker is unreachable it
falls back to delivering inline rather than dropping the event: a notification
is best effort, but "Redis blipped" is not a reason to lose one.
