"""Engagement Hub Celery tasks: what happens around a booking and a meeting.

Every `_impl` takes a Session and an explicit `now`, matching
app/workers/outreach_tasks.py, so the test suite drives them directly on
SQLite without a broker.

WHY THE POST-BOOKING WORK IS A TASK AND NOT PART OF THE REQUEST
The public booking endpoint is the last thing a prospect touches before they
believe they have a meeting. Everything after the row is written -- two
emails, a lead status change, an outcome, a CRM activity, pausing whatever
sequence was mid-flight -- is work that must not be able to fail their
booking. A confirmation email that times out has to leave a booked meeting
behind, not a 500 and a prospect who tries again.

So the endpoint commits the booking and returns; this module does the rest,
with retries. If the whole task fails permanently the booking still exists and
is visible on the host's calendar -- degraded, not lost.
