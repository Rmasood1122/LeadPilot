"""Channel stagnation: a pipeline step that moves a quiet lead to its next best
channel (Feature A4).

The research pipeline in engine.py builds a strategy; this step runs over the
EXECUTING side of it -- every active enrollment -- once an hour (Celery beat,
app/workers/channel_tasks.py) and on demand.

STAGNANT means: the lead's last N sends on one channel -- all sent after the
lead's last GENUINE reply on any channel -- went unanswered, and the newest of
them is at least `stagnation_min_hours` old. N is `stagnation_email_sends` for
email (default 3) and `stagnation_other_sends` for everything else (default 2).
Out-of-office notices, auto-responders and bounces are not replies.

THE NEXT CHANNEL is the first that is actually usable for THIS lead:
  * allowed by the owner's plan (app/core/plans.py channels);
  * reachable: an email address / a LinkedIn URL plus a connected LinkedIn
    account / a number with recorded call consent while AI calling is enabled
    / a WhatsApp opt-in;
  * not a channel the lead is already stagnant on.
The order is `ranking` (Feature A5's outcome-based channel ranking when
available) and otherwise a fixed preference: from email -> LinkedIn -> phone ->
WhatsApp; from anything else -> email first.

WHAT HAPPENS. A `channel_suggestions` row, always. With
`stagnation_auto_switch_enabled`, the lead's NEXT SCHEDULED message is moved to
the new channel in place -- it keeps its step and brief, is rendered for the new
channel at send time, and still passes every send-time gate (suppression,
consent, caps, windows, the claim engine). Nothing is ever scheduled twice.
WhatsApp is suggest-only: a cold WhatsApp touch needs an approved template, a
choice a person makes.
