# ClientHunter Enterprise — System Handoff

*Last updated: M8 Chunks 4+5 (final milestone). All 8 milestones complete.*

---

## What is this system?

An end-to-end, self-learning B2B client acquisition platform. You describe a product or skill, and the system:
1. Researches your market (72-step pipeline), builds a verified strategy (10 verification passes).
2. Sources leads (Apollo + Hunter), enriches them, sequences outreach (Gmail + WhatsApp).
3. Books meetings (Calendly webhooks), tracks outcomes, and improves its own strategies over time.
4. Runs 24/7 in the cloud — continues even when your device is off.

## Status — Everything built

### M1 — Backend core
- FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Celery + Redis
- 72-step research pipeline (8 phases × 9 steps, resumable)
- 10-pass verification loop
- Product/skill intake, past-client pattern extraction

### M2 — Lead sourcing
- Apollo.io adapter (people/company search + enrichment)
- Hunter.io adapter (email find + verify)
- Suppression list, bounce handling

### M3 — Gmail sequences + Calendly
- Gmail OAuth 2.0 per user, warm-up schedule, daily send cap
- Sequence + step engine, reply detection
- Calendly webhook → "meeting_booked" outcome

### M4 — WhatsApp
- WhatsApp Business Cloud API (Meta)
- Template message enforcement (cold contact only)
- 24-hour customer service window for free-form replies

### M5 — Web UI + Theme Engine
- Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- 5 preset themes + full custom mode (CSS variables, live preview)
- Kanban pipeline, campaigns, analytics, settings
- Vitest unit tests, Playwright E2E

### M6 — pip SDK + CLI
- `pip install clienthunter`
- Typer/Rich CLI: `clienthunter init|run|status|serve`
- 60 passing tests

### M7 — Android mobile app
- Capacitor 6 wrapper (static Next.js export)
- FCM push notifications
- Deep links, native Preferences storage
- GitHub Actions release pipeline (android-release.yml)

### M8 — Learning loop
**Chunk 1:** Outcomes aggregation, playbook scores, nightly Celery Beat job.
**Chunk 2:** A/B testing (binary, Welch's t-test), auto-promotion with 4-gate guard.
**Chunk 3:** Strategy similarity (TF-IDF cosine), playbook injection at Phases 6+8, pipeline monitoring + admin dashboard.
**Chunk 4 (advanced learning):**
- Send-time optimizer (Redis-cached slot recommendations per channel+ICP)
- Score decay engine (exponential decay, configurable half-life, trend labels)
- Multi-variate testing (Kruskal-Wallis + Bonferroni, up to 5 variants)
- Subject line intelligence (8 pattern classifiers, nightly extraction + injection)
- Personalization quality scorer (field-presence check at send time, Pearson correlation nightly)
**Chunk 5 (production launch):**
- Redis sliding-window rate limiting (per-user, per-endpoint, fails open)
- Plan enforcement (free/starter/pro, HTTP 402, PlanGate dependency)
- Reliable outbound webhooks (HMAC-signed, 5-retry exponential backoff, delivery log)
- User onboarding flow (7-step JSONB state, auto-detected by services)
- PyPI release workflow (4-job: build → TestPyPI → smoke test → PyPI)
- Performance benchmark script (dry-run + JSON output)

## What is NOT built (honest list)

These are out of scope and would be next-phase work:

- **LinkedIn outreach channel.** LinkedIn's official API doesn't allow automated outreach at this level. A compliant implementation would require a LinkedIn partnership or manual workflow.
- **Stripe billing / payment.** Plan upgrade is currently handled via email (`upgrade@clienthunter.io`). There is no payment processing built in.
- **Real-time push for web.** The web frontend polls via React Query. WebSocket push for "strategy complete" / "meeting booked" events is not built.
- **Self-hosted email deliverability.** The system uses Gmail OAuth per user. A dedicated SMTP warm-up infrastructure (Mailgun/Postmark with domain authentication) is not built but is the right production path for high volume.
- **iOS/App Store app.** The Capacitor wrapper targets Android (Google Play). A separate Xcode build + provisioning profile is needed for iOS.
- **Multi-tenant team accounts.** All objects are user-scoped (user_id). Team-level sharing, role-based access within an org, and white-labeling are not built.
- **HubSpot / Salesforce CRM sync.** The outbound webhook system (M8-C5) lets you push events to any CRM via webhook, but there are no native CRM integration adapters.

## Three-client architecture

```
[Web App (Next.js)]   [Android (Capacitor)]   [CLI/SDK (pip)]
         \                    |                    /
          +--------- REST API (FastAPI) ----------+
                              |
              +-----------+---+-----------+
              |           |               |
         PostgreSQL    Celery workers    Redis
          (all data)  (research, send,  (queue, cache,
                       learn, monitor)   rate limits)
                              |
                External APIs: Anthropic, Apollo,
                Hunter, Gmail, WhatsApp, Calendly
```

All automation runs on the cloud backend. Clients are read-windows, not the engine.

## Costs at scale (rough estimates)

| Scale | Anthropic (claude-sonnet-4-6) | Apollo/Hunter | Infra | Total/mo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100 strategies/mo | ~$15 | ~$50 | $20 (Railway starter) | ~$85 |
| 1,000 strategies/mo | ~$150 | ~$200 | $80 (Railway pro) | ~$430 |
| 10,000 strategies/mo | ~$1,500 | ~$1,200 | $400 (Docker on AWS) | ~$3,100 |

*At 10k strategies/month, move to Anthropic Batch API for 50% cost reduction.*

## "Your system gets smarter" — what the timeline actually looks like

| Campaigns sent | What improves |
|---|---|
| 0–50 | Nothing yet — no reliable data. Uses best-practice defaults. |
| 50–150 | First playbook scores form. A/B winners start emerging. |
| 150–300 | Send-time optimizer gets reliable slots. Subject patterns become statistically significant. |
| 300–500 | Personalization correlation becomes meaningful. Multi-variate tests can complete. |
| 500+ | System is consistently outperforming the defaults. Score decay keeps it current. |
